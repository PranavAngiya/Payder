This is a personal log of this things that need
to be done on the front end.

TODO:
Create temporary link to homepage on login page

Update login page. Space that was meant for browsing can be
used instead to create a larger and more sophisticated search
bar for finding a specific companies stock.

Need to flesh out the features for the settings portion
of the application such as enabling two factor authentication,
updating personal settings, or increasing the amount on your
current balance / adding more payment options. 

Need to hammer javascript file in order to send emails to clients.
These emails could be used for two factor authentication or
in order to notify a client that their payment has been transferred
successfully (email with an order number for instance).
